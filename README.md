# IdleHands

## HopHacks Fall 2018

Idle Hands aims to augment existing calendar functionalities by allowing a more flexible means of schedule planning. By separating events into the  concrete -- tied to specific times and places -- and the freestanding -- flexible tasks that may be tied to a specific location, but not time, Idle Hands is able to suggest where the freestanding tasks fit in seamlessly.
